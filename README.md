# Country Info App

## Description

The **Country Info App** is an Angular application that provides detailed information about countries around the world. Users can search for countries, view their details, and learn about their borders, holidays etc.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) (install with `npm install -g @angular/cli`)

## Getting Started

To set up and run the Country Info App locally, follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git https://github.com/Feramizxx/angular-holiday-app.git


### Install Dependencies

Install the required npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the Application

To start the development server and run the application locally:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will start the Angular development server and open the application in your default web browser. The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200/`.

### Build the Application

To create a production build of the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a production-ready build in the `dist/` directory. The build is optimized for performance and ready for deployment to a web server.

### Watch for Changes

To build the application in watch mode (for development):

```bash
npm run watch
```

This will automatically rebuild the application when changes are made to the source files.


### Lint the Code

To check the code for style issues and enforce coding standards:

```bash
npm run lint
```

This command will use ESLint (or the configured linter) to analyze the code and highlight any issues.

### Format the Code

To format the code according to Prettier’s rules:

```bash
npm run format
```

This will format all specified files in the `src` directory.

## Configuration

You can adjust the application’s settings by modifying the following files:

- `.prettierrc` – Prettier configuration for code formatting
- `angular.json` – Angular CLI configuration
- `src/environments/environment.ts` – Environment-specific settings

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can use it to:

- **Search for Countries**: Enter the name of a country to get detailed information.
- **View Country Details**: Explore data such as Official Name, Region, Neighboring Countries and Holidays for each country.
